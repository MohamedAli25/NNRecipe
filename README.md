# NNRecipe
A Deep-Learning framework -for learning purposes- inspired by keras

## Framework Design
NNRecipe is divided into 3 main modules: 
  - **NN**: Neural Network, which implements most of the Neural Network API like: layers, activation functions, etc.
  - **Opt**: Optimizers, Implements diffrent current of optimizers for NN module like: GCD, etc.
  - **Loader**: Data Loader mechanism to save/load the neural network, load data sets, etc.
  - **Visual**: Visualization module to implement some visulatizations for the Neural Network training.
